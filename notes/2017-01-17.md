Vittorio: Is it possible to define interactions if the user has installed another specific skill or not? Transfer to another skill, or to check if enabled.

Tom: Is there or will there be an API like the Developer Publishing API ( https://developer.amazon.com/developer-publishing ) that will allow one to programmatically create and update skills in the way that DPAPI does for Android apps? (Use case: I need to create 70+ skills and it's gonna be quite a grind)

Juan: I have ideas for skills that requires geolocation, there is already something that I can interact with the phone's geolocation or should I create an app that will be the one sharing the data to the cloud and the skill getting the data from it?

Fransesco: do we have to re-register for office hours each week, or is there a way to "subscribe" and get the link emailed to us weekly?

Laurie: (ditto above) I asked for this meeting to be recurring a year ago...;-)

#CERTIFICATION | POLICY
